# AI-Powered-Language-Translation-
Welcome to the AI-Powered Language Translation repository! This project focuses on developing a system capable of translating text between different languages using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. 🌐📜


Features 🌟
Text Preprocessing 📝:

Cleans and prepares text data for translation, handling punctuation, and special characters.
Machine Translation Models 🤖:

Implements state-of-the-art machine translation models such as Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT) for accurate and context-aware translations.
Multiple Language Support 🌐:

Supports translation between a wide range of languages, facilitating global communication and understanding.
Real-Time Translation ⏱️:

Deploys a system capable of translating text in real-time, either through a web interface or API integration.
